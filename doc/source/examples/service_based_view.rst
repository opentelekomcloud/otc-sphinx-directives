Elastic Cloud Server
====================

An ECS is a computing server consisting of CPUs, memory, images, and Elastic
Volume Service (EVS) disks that allow on-demand allocation and elastic
scaling. ECSs integrate virtual private cloud (VPC), virtual firewalls,
and multi-data-copy capabilities to create an efficient, reliable, and
secure computing environment. This ensures stable and uninterrupted
operation of services.
